This repository presents an AI model built using deep learning techniques model developed to distinguish between genuine audio clips and synthetically generated audio (audio deepfakes). The model is trained to identify subtle characteristics that differentiate real and AI-manipulated audio, aiding in the fight against misinformation and deception.
